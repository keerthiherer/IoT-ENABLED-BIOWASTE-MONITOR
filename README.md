# IoT-Based Plastic Degradation & Methane Utilization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on using **BIO DEGRADING PROCESS** to degrade BIO waste while simultaneously capturing **methane gas**, which is utilized in **biofuel cells**. The system integrates **IoT sensors (MQ-6 Gas Sensor, DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor, and ESP CAM)** to monitor the process in real-time. Data is uploaded to **ThingSpeak** and processed using **Django REST framework** for analysis and optimization.
